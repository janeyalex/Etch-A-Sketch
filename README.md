# Etch-A-Sketch

# Summary
My program was inspired by an etch-a-sketch but has the functionality of a white board that the user
can draw on. All the buttons are located at the top of the window. These include <br />
-- the DRAW button which allows the user to begin drawing <br />
-- the GUIDE button which will draw a template of a house and a tree on the screen that the user can color in <br />
-- the THIN, MEDIUM, and THICK buttons which will change the thickness of the pen <br />
-- the 5 color options that will change the color of the pen <br /> 
-- the SHAKE button which will erase the board <br />
-- and the EXIT button which when pressed will prompt the user if they are sure they want to exit and either destroy the window or go back to the whiteboard <br />

# Concepts Used
**Module 4- Graphics** <br />
    The program primarily uses graphics to create this program <br />

**Module 2 - Is-A** <br />
    This program uses the is-a relationship. The shape class is the parent class and then there are separate shape classes that
    inherit from shape. There is also a button class that is a child of the rectangle class

# Operating System
I used a MaC operating system for this project

# Added Installation
There is no added installation for this project, unless the user is not on a MaC

# Citations
The bones of this code are reused from the runner project. However, the structure of the code was 
primarily used and not the graphics from runner. For example, the rect and circle class were used. The button class was used
from the confetti guided project and modified so that it would inherit from a class in this project. All
code used to make the actual etch-a-sketch was written by me.
